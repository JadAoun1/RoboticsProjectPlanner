## About RoboPlanner

Have you ever started a robotics project only to lose track of all the components you need, the tools required, or how much you're actually spending? I built RoboPlanner because I was tired of using scattered spreadsheets and sticky notes to manage my robotics builds.

RoboPlanner is a comprehensive web application designed specifically for robotics enthusiasts, students, and professionals who want to stay organized throughout their project journey. Whether you're building your first Arduino-based robot or developing a complex autonomous system, RoboPlanner keeps everything in one place so you can focus on what matters most - building amazing robots.

### What Makes RoboPlanner Special?

As someone who's struggled with project organization in the past, I designed RoboPlanner to solve real problems that robotics builders face:

- **Smart Component Tracking**: Never wonder "do I have enough servos?" again - track quantities, estimated costs, and actual costs for every part
- **Tool Management**: Keep a master list of tools needed so you're never caught without the right equipment
- **Budget Control**: Automatic cost calculations help you stay within budget and track spending overruns
- **Project Documentation**: Built-in note-taking system to document your build process, lessons learned, and troubleshooting steps
- **Visual Inspiration**: Create moodboards with inspiring images and reference designs
- **Secure & Personal**: Your projects are private and secure with user authentication

## Getting Started

üöÄ **Try RoboPlanner Live**: [https://roboticsprojectplanner.onrender.com](https://roboticsprojectplanner.onrender.com)

üìã **Planning Materials**: This project was developed as part of a Django web development course, focusing on creating a full-stack application with user authentication, CRUD functionality, and responsive design.

### Quick Start Guide

1. **Sign Up**: Create your free account at the link above
2. **Create Your First Project**: Click "New Project" and give your robotics build a name
3. **Add Components**: Start listing all the parts you need with quantities and estimated costs
4. **Track Tools**: Add the tools and equipment required for your build
5. **Document Everything**: Use the notes section to track your progress and lessons learned
6. **Gather Inspiration**: Build a moodboard with reference images and design ideas
7. **Monitor Your Budget**: Watch your costs automatically calculate as you add components

## Attributions

This project was built with the help of several excellent open-source technologies and resources:
