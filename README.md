## About RoboPlanner

RoboPlanner is a web application designed specifically for robotics enthusiasts, students, and professionals who want to stay organized throughout their project journey. Whether you're building your first Arduino-based robot or developing a complex autonomous system, RoboPlanner keeps everything in one place so you can focus on what matters most - building amazing robots.

### What Makes RoboPlanner Special?

As someone who's struggled with project organization in the past, I designed RoboPlanner to solve real problems that robotics builders face:

- **Smart Component Tracking**: Never wonder "do I have enough servos?" again - track quantities, estimated costs, and actual costs for every part
- **Tool Management**: Keep a master list of tools needed so you're never caught without the right equipment
- **Budget Control**: Automatic cost calculations help you stay within budget and track spending overruns
- **Project Documentation**: Built-in note-taking system to document your build process, lessons learned, and troubleshooting steps
- **Visual Inspiration**: Create moodboards with inspiring images and reference designs
- **Secure & Personal**: Your projects are private and secure with user authentication
