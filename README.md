# RoboPlanner - Robotics Project Manager

## About RoboPlanner

RoboPlanner is a Django web application designed for robotics enthusiasts, students, and professionals to plan, organize, and manage their robotics projects. Whether you're building a simple Arduino robot or a complex autonomous system, RoboPlanner helps you keep track of all the essential components, tools, costs, notes, and inspiration images in one centralized location.

### Why RoboPlanner?

As a newbie in robotics, I found it challenging to keep track of all the different components, tools, and costs involved in robotics projects. Traditional project management tools weren't designed for the specific needs of hardware projects. RoboPlanner bridges this gap by providing:

- **Component Management**: Track all parts with quantities, estimated vs. actual costs
- **Tool Tracking**: Maintain a list of required tools for each project
- **Cost Analysis**: Automatic calculation of total project costs
- **Documentation**: Rich note-taking system for project documentation
- **Visual Inspiration**: Moodboard functionality to collect inspiring images and designs
- **User Authentication**: Secure, personal project management

## Features

- **Project Management**: Create and organize multiple robotics projects
- **Parts Inventory**: Track components with quantities and cost analysis
- **Tool Management**: Maintain lists of required tools and equipment
- **Note System**: Rich documentation with timestamps
- **Moodboard**: Visual inspiration collection with image URLs and captions
- **Cost Tracking**: Automatic calculation of total project costs
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and user-specific data
- **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on desktop, tablet, and mobile
